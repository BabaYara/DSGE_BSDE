# `kfac_pinn`

Lightweight Python utilities implementing a diagonal
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) optimiser for
Physics-informed neural networks.  The package provides a
`KFACPINNSolver` training loop, a minimal `kfac_update` optimiser and
helper functions for toy Poisson equations.

See the notebooks in [`../notebooks`](../notebooks) for example usage.
