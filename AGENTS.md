# Agent Notes: Multicountry Model (Probab_01.pdf)

Status: Iteration 1 complete (scaffold + hooks)

Source of truth

- All model details, equations, and target statistics are in `Probab_01.pdf` (repo root). Additionally, see `Tex/Model.tex` for the authoritative LaTeX source with equation labels (eqs. 19–22) and the symmetric-state Table 1 values. Treat these as the primary references when wiring the generator/terminal and populating Table 1 targets.

Objectives

- Build a VS Code notebook that solves the multicountry model from Probab_01.pdf and reproduces Table 1.
- Extend primitives with richer figures/animations for clarity.
- Improve exposition, rigor, and technical clarity across docs/notebooks.
- Use TDD: add focused tests for new ND solver, network, and model wiring.
- Harden rubric/checklist for replication and quality.

What’s done (this pass)

- Multicountry notebook scaffolded with calibration loader, stats+comparison hooks, sample-path plots, and animation.
- ND library in place: `ResNetND`, `SolverND`, vector-valued `BSDEProblem.step` supports matrix diffusion.
- Primitives notebook expanded: Sobol vs Gaussian, bisection animation, variance growth, ResNetND feature maps.
- Tests added/refined: ND shapes, matrix diffusion step, calibration loader, metrics compare utility, multicountry wiring smoke tests.
- Research log structured with clear mapping placeholders and JSON schema; CLI script to check Table 1.

Scope & Deliverables

- Notebook: `notebooks/multicountry_probab01.ipynb` (solver, calibration hooks, figures, animations, summary table computation).
- Notebook: `notebooks/primitives_visuals.ipynb` (Sobol vs. Gaussian paths, bisection convergence animation, ResNet feature maps).
- Library: `ResNetND` and `SolverND` for vector-valued states and controls.
- Model: `bsde_dsgE/models/multicountry.py` as a skeleton aligned to Table 1 structure.
- Tests: `tests/test_resnet_nd.py`, `tests/test_multicountry_model.py`.
- Research log: `docs/research_notes.md`.

Assumptions/Constraints

- Network access is restricted; cannot scrape Probab_01.pdf. Table 1 calibration values must be provided or transcribed.
- Current scalar `Solver` is placeholder-like; ND variant mirrors that structure to avoid breaking existing tests.

 Open Questions

1) Exact state definition and generator for Probab_01.pdf Table 1 (consumption vs dividend states, correlated shocks?).
2) Terminal condition: paper-specific terminal value vs. zero (currently placeholder zero in path-sim scaffolds; deep-solver uses eq. (20) driver and ζ,η dynamics (21)-(22)).
3) Calibrations: parameter sets, priors, and target moments.

 Next Steps

- [x] Integrate calibration loader (JSON/YAML) once Table 1 values are available.
- [x] Add moment-matching routine and assert table reproduction within tolerance (hooks + tests; enable strict asserts once targets provided).
- [x] Expand animations (rolling impulse responses, diffusion heatmaps) in notebooks.
- [x] Transcribe Table 1 from `Probab_01.pdf` into `data/probab01_table1.json` (including any `Sigma` correlation structure).
- [x] Derive and implement generator and ζ,η dynamics from `Probab_01.pdf` eqs (19)–(22); wire into `probab01_equations.py` and solver script.
- [ ] Fill paper-specific terminal condition if required (currently zero in scaffolds), and validate its effect on matching Table 1.
- [x] Add MacroFinanceNet (Try.md idea) with sign‑constrained `sigma_q` and symmetric‑state evaluator for Table 1 blocks.
- [x] Add equations module + training script; document training workflow.

Execution Log (high level)

- Implemented BSDEProblem step with matrix diffusion via einsum; added test exercising per-sample 2×2 matrix.
- Implemented `SolverND` and `ResNetND`; added shape tests and solver smoke test with vector states.
- Wrote metrics utilities to compute mean/std/cov/corr and compare to targets; added tests.
- Created `scripts/check_table1.py` to simulate forward states and print comparison.
- Multicountry notebook: calibration loader, sample path plots, animation, diffusion heatmap, impulse responses, summary/compare cell.
- Primitives notebook: Sobol vs Gaussian visuals, bisection animation, variance growth, ResNetND feature-map heatmaps.
- Added `multicountry_probab01_solver.ipynb` with MacroFinanceNet evaluation; sign‑pattern checks vs transcribed Table 1.
- Added `primitives_visuals_extra.ipynb` with 2D diffusion heatmap and rolling dispersion animation.
- Added `bsde_dsgE/models/probab01_equations.py` (Try.md equations sketch) and `scripts/train_macro_solver.py` with one-step Euler consistency loss; added `docs/training_guide.md`.
 - Aligned `probab01_equations.compute_dynamics` with Model.tex: corrected b_η second term to `((1/η)-1)^2·η·∑σ²` and set ζ drift cross-vol sign to negative per eq. (22). Updated `data/probab01_table1.json` symmetric-state (η=0.7) to match the table ordering.
 - Added LaTeX extractor `bsde_dsgE/utils/tex_extract.py` and CLI `scripts/update_table1_from_tex.py` to sync `table1_values` from `Tex/Model.tex` (Symmetric State table). Added tests covering extractor and CLI dry-run.

Rubric (Hardened)

- Correctness: Shapes/types/finite checks for ND nets/solvers; matrix-diffusion step tested; calibration loader validated; Table 1 replication uses assert-allclose once targets are provided.
- Reproducibility: Fixed seeds; `NOTEBOOK_FAST` mode; CPU-only friendly; notebooks pin versions in text and echo parameters; deterministic sampling for figures where feasible.
- Clarity: Explicit math-to-code mapping (state, drift, diffusion, generator, terminal); inline notes and references to equations; clear discussion of limitations vs. Probab_01.pdf.
- Diagnostics: Loss traces, sample paths, animations, summary stats with error bars; print calibration used, device info, and random seeds.
- Extensibility: Simple calibration JSON; pluggable `dim`, solver hyperparams; hooks to compute and validate Table 1 moments; modular code paths to swap generator/terminal.
- Performance: Reasonable defaults for batch, dt; guidance for scaling up; fast-mode paths verified in tests.

Checklist (to verify before claiming replication)

- Seeds fixed and echoed in notebooks/CLI; `NOTEBOOK_FAST` mode covered by tests.
- Calibration file parsed and validated; Sigma correlation structure handled.
- Generator and terminal match `Probab_01.pdf` equations (transcribed with references in research notes).
- Simulation path stats match Table 1 targets within tolerances using `compare_to_targets`.
- Figures: state sample paths, animation, diffusion heatmap; primitives visuals include Sobol vs Gaussian, variance growth, bisection animation, ResNetND feature maps.
- Tests pass locally (`pytest -q`), including ND, metrics, calibration, and integration smoke tests.
- MacroFinanceNet Table 1: sign pattern holds (diag>0, off<0) and, after training, `STRICT_TABLE1=1` passes with `TABLE1_Q_TOL` at paper-level tolerance.
- CI: `ci/lint_test.yml` includes an optional `table1-check` job gated on `STRICT_TABLE1=1`. Enable this repository/environment variable in GitHub Actions to assert the moments strictly in CI once training/tolerances are stable.

Iteration 2 (this pass)

What’s new

- Multicountry notebook enhanced: added mean±2SE bar plots and a rolling correlation heatmap animation; clarified math→code mapping and FAST‑mode guidance (first cell prints seed, device, dt, batch).
- Primitives notebook expanded: added antithetic‑pairing demo (paired path correlation ≈ −1) and a quick path‑pair visual; improved animation captions and inline notes.
- Online research notes expanded with structured placeholders for key references and implementation insights (to be filled with DOIs/links offline). Added a concise replication checklist in docs/replication_checklist.md and linked it here.
- Tests expanded: added script smoke test for `scripts/check_table1.py` (skips if JAX missing), reinforced sign‑pattern checks against transcribed Table 1 blocks. Added notebook content tag tests to ensure required figures/sections (Mean±2SE, rolling correlations, antithetic pairing, feature maps) remain present.
- Tests expanded: added script smoke test for `scripts/check_table1.py` (skips if JAX missing), reinforced sign‑pattern checks against transcribed Table 1 blocks. Added notebook content tag tests to ensure required figures/sections (Mean±2SE, rolling correlations, antithetic pairing, feature maps) remain present. Added utils tests for rolling correlations, mean±2SE, path simulation, and impulse responses.
- Rubric hardened: explicit “Table 1 gating” with `STRICT_TABLE1=1` and `TABLE1_Q_TOL`; notebook cells print seeds, device, and calibration in the first section. Replication checklist codified in docs/replication_checklist.md and referenced from README.
 - CLI gating extended: `scripts/compare_table1_solver.py` now honors `STRICT_TABLE1=1` with `TABLE1_Q_TOL` to bound symmetric‑state q errors.
  - Moments CLI improved: `scripts/check_table1.py` prints seed/device/FAST config, adapts defaults under `NOTEBOOK_FAST`, and supports `--sobol` QMC with antithetic pairing.
  - Added `--from-tex` to `scripts/compare_table1_solver.py` to compare predicted q against values parsed directly from `Tex/Model.tex` (Symmetric State table) without relying on JSON.

Library additions

- New module `bsde_dsgE/utils/figures.py` with:
  - `mean_and_2se(xs)`, `rolling_corr(xs, window)` for notebook plots/animations.
  - `simulate_paths(problem, x0, steps, dt)` and `impulse_response(problem, x0, ...)` for diagnostics/IRFs.
- `multicountry_probab01` now accepts `terminal_fn` override to enable paper‑specific terminal conditions without changing call sites.
 - Added CLI smoke test for `scripts/compare_table1_solver.py` to ensure solver–Table‑1 comparison runs under FAST mode.

Run/verify (local)

- Notebooks (FAST): `make run-notebooks` (executes primitives + multicountry notebooks via nbconvert).
- Moments check: `make table1-check` (use `make strict-table1` after targets are finalized).
- Tests: `make test` (sets `NOTEBOOK_FAST=1` for speed).

Notes on this pass

- Environment in this harness lacks JAX/Jupyter/pytest; tests and notebook execution are validated via tags and metadata. Full runs are expected locally with proper deps per README and scripts/env_check.py.
- Table 1 numeric matching remains gated until final targets are confirmed; CLI and notebooks print comparison summaries. The MacroFinanceNet enforces σ_q sign pattern by construction; strict numeric checks should be enabled post‑training.

Iteration 3 (current)

What’s new

- Primitives: added QQ plots of increments (Sobol vs Gaussian) and a lag‑1 autocorrelation check; antithetic pairing retained with clearer captions. See `bsde_dsgE/utils/figures.py::qq_points` and `::lag_autocorr`.
- Multicountry notebook: explicit “Equations (19)–(22) linkage” note connecting `Tex/Model.tex` to `bsde_dsgE/models/probab01_equations.py`; referenced `scripts/compare_table1_solver.py --from-tex` for direct LaTeX comparison.
- Online research notes expanded with planned citations and diagnostic tips (QQ/ACF) for RNG correctness.

Tests

- Added `tests/test_utils_figures_extra.py` covering `qq_points` shape/monotonicity and `lag_autocorr` behaviour on white noise.
- Notebook content gates include sections for Mean ± 2SE, rolling correlations, antithetic pairing, feature maps, QQ plot, and lagged autocorrelation.
- CLI smoke for `scripts/compare_table1_solver.py` added; tolerance gate via `STRICT_TABLE1=1` + `TABLE1_Q_TOL` retained.

Rubric/gating

- Replication checklist updated to include QQ and lag‑1 autocorr diagnostics under primitives. Strict Table 1 gating unchanged (enable via `STRICT_TABLE1=1`).

Context7 doc lookups

- Equinox: reaffirmed use of `eqx.filter_jit`/`filter_value_and_grad` patterns for JIT‑compiled training/eval (docs: /patrick-kidger/equinox). Our nets/solvers follow these idioms.
- JAX randomness: reinforced best practices (never reuse keys; split for batches; no sequential equivalence; prefer vectorised draws) drawn from JAX docs (/jax-ml/jax). Incorporated into notes and RNG‑related utilities.

Next steps

- Fill paper‑specific terminal condition, quantify its impact on Table 1 matching.
- Finalize Table 1 targets (replace placeholders) and enable strict tolerances in CI.
- Train MacroFinanceNet end‑to‑end and validate against `table1_values` and moment targets.


Run instructions (local)

- Notebooks: set `NOTEBOOK_FAST=1` for quick runs; open `notebooks/multicountry_probab01.ipynb` and `notebooks/multicountry_probab01_solver.ipynb` in VS Code and run all cells. For headless, if available: `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute <path>.ipynb`.
- Table 1 CLI check: `python scripts/check_table1.py --calib data/probab01_table1.json --steps 100 --paths 32 --dt 0.02` (set `STRICT_TABLE1=1` to enforce assertions once targets are final).
- Tests: `pytest -q` (repo assumes JAX/Equinox/SciPy installed). Tests will skip gracefully where calibration or JAX are absent.

Next steps

- Fill paper‐specific terminal condition and quantify its impact on Table 1 matching.
- Transcribe final Table 1 targets (replace placeholders) and enable strict tolerances in CI.
- Train `MacroFinanceNet` (Try.md) end‑to‑end and validate against `table1_values` and moment targets.

Iteration 3 (current)

What’s new

- Primitives notebook enriched: added QQ plots of increments (Sobol vs Gaussian) and a lag‑1 autocorrelation check; both surface RNG/distribution issues quickly. Antithetic pairing and variance‑growth sections retained with clearer captions.
- Figures utils extended: added `qq_points(samples)` and `lag_autocorr(xs, lag)` in `bsde_dsgE/utils/figures.py` to support the new visuals without heavy deps.
- Multicountry notebook clarified: explicit “Equations (19)–(22) linkage” note tying code to `Tex/Model.tex` and `probab01_equations.py` and pointing to the `--from-tex` CLI.
- Online research notes expanded: added planned citations list and diagnostic tips (QQ/ACF) for RNG correctness.

Tests

- Added `tests/test_utils_figures_extra.py` covering `qq_points` shape/monotonicity and `lag_autocorr` behaviour on white noise.
- Notebook content remains gated by tags/strings: sections for Mean ± 2SE, rolling correlations, antithetic pairing, feature maps, QQ plot, and lagged autocorrelation now present.

Rubric/gating

- Replication checklist updated to include QQ and lag‑1 autocorr diagnostics under primitives. Strict Table 1 gating unchanged (enable via `STRICT_TABLE1=1`).

Notes

- Environment here cannot execute notebooks/tests; local runs via `make run-notebooks` and `pytest -q` remain the verification path. Equinox/JAX docs consulted via MCP Context7 for `eqx.filter_jit` and JAX randomness best‑practices (key splitting, lack of sequential equivalence).
